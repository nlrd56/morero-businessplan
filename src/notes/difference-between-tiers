Tier 1

Who they are:
Main contractors and designers who hold a direct contract with the client.

What they do:
They manage the whole project. They coordinate all Tier 2 packages. They also sometimes self-deliver some work.

Evidence:
Tier 1 are “designers and constructors that have a direct contract with the ultimate client”.

Tier 2

Who they are:
Specialist contractors and suppliers who have a sub-contract with the Tier 1 contractor.

Examples:
Cladding, building services, finishes contractors, novated design consultants, manufacturers, plant suppliers.

Evidence:
Tier 2 are “designers, constructors and suppliers with a sub-contract with the Tier one contractor”.

The report also says Tier 2 almost always has many small transactions and handles large packages of work (e.g. structure, envelope, MEP).

Tier 3

Who they are:
Sub-sub-contractors who work for Tier 2. They are the ones doing most of the actual physical work.

Examples:
Specialist trades, small subcontractors, plant hire firms, material suppliers.

Evidence:
Tier 3 are “designers, constructors and suppliers with a sub-contract with a Tier two sub-contractor”.

And most construction work is actually delivered at this level or below.

Simple view

Tier 1. Main contractor. Manages the project. Holds the client contract.
Tier 2. Specialist contractors. Deliver major packages. Contracted to Tier 1.
Tier 3. Sub-sub contractors. Deliver the work on site. Contracted to Tier 2.

Here is the organisational difference, kept simple and clear.

Tier 1. Large, structured organisations

What they look like:
Large companies with full internal teams.
Project managers. Commercial teams. Planners. Design managers. HSE. Quality. Supply chain. Finance.

How they operate:
They run the whole project.
They buy large packages.
They manage risk.
They manage programme.
They hold the legal contract with the client.

Typical size:
National contractors or strong regional main contractors.

Tier 2. Medium sized specialist organisations

What they look like:
Specialist companies with focused expertise.
Usually have a smaller management structure.
A director. A project manager. A small commercial team. A design coordinator if needed. Foremen and labour.

How they operate:
They deliver one major package (structure, MEP, cladding etc).
They manage their own smaller supply chain.
They balance design, procurement and installation for their package.

Typical size:
£1m to £10m businesses. Often SME but established.
Strong technical competence but limited resources compared to Tier 1.

Tier 3. Small trade-based organisations

What they look like:
Small subcontractors. Often micro-businesses.
A director who is also on the tools.
Very limited office structure.
Rely on Tier 2 for coordination.

How they operate:
They supply labour, small materials or plant.
They respond to instructions from Tier 2.
They work day-to-day on site.
They have little commercial protection.

Typical size:
Small SMEs. Often <10 staff.
Low overhead. High dependence on cashflow.

Simple organisational difference

Tier 1. Fully structured business. Management-heavy. Plans and controls everything.
Tier 2. Specialist business. Delivers one complex package. Mix of office and site.
Tier 3. Small trade business. Delivers the physical work. Very limited structure.

Why P&D want to move from Tier 3 to Tier 2
1. More control over work

Tier 3 firms follow instructions from Tier 2.
They have little influence over programme, design or sequencing.
Moving to Tier 2 gives P&D control of a full package.
This means fewer surprises and better planning.

2. Better margins

Tier 3 margins are tight.
They compete on labour and small tasks.
Tier 2 package work has higher value and higher margins.
This helps the business grow safely.

3. More stable cashflow

Tier 3 firms rely on weekly or monthly labour payments.
They feel cashflow pressure.
Tier 2 firms are paid for whole packages.
Payments are larger and more predictable.

4. Stronger position in the supply chain

Tier 3 firms get pushed around commercially.
Tier 2 firms choose their own suppliers and control their own delivery.
It strengthens their relationships and reputation.

5. Ability to scale

Tier 3 businesses hit a ceiling.
They cannot grow without taking on package responsibility.
Tier 2 status allows them to expand the team, the scope and the systems.

6. Better long term prospects

Tier 2 firms win repeat work more easily.
Clients trust those who deliver packages, not just labour.
This makes the business more resilient.
