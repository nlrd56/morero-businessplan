pandd-environmental.co.uk
.
The company emphasizes turnkey project delivery – from design through to installation – especially for projects “on or near the water”
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. P&D Environmental has experience working in sensitive and regulated environments: they note successful projects on Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and historic waterways structures, coordinating with authorities like the UK Environment Agency and Canal & River Trust to secure necessary permits
pandd-environmental.co.uk
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. The client base spans public bodies (e.g. harbour commissioners, municipal water authorities) and private sectors (marinas, construction and leisure industries)
pandd-environmental.co.uk
inlandandcoastal.com
. For example, the company has built heavy-duty pontoons for harbor authorities and undertaken dredging to improve flood defenses
inlandandcoastal.com
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. Certifications & Accreditations: P&D Environmental holds multiple industry accreditations, underscoring its commitment to quality, safety, and environmental standards. It is accredited under CHAS (Contractors Health and Safety Assessment Scheme) and maintains certified management systems ISO 9001 (Quality) and ISO 14001 (Environmental)
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. The firm is a Constructionline Gold member and part of the Safety Schemes in Procurement (SSIP), evidencing high pre-qualification standards in construction safety
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. They are also members of the British Marine Federation, reflecting involvement in the marine industry’s professional network
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. On the personnel side, all site staff carry CSCS certifications (Construction Skills Certification Scheme for health & safety) and have completed DEFRA-approved water safety courses
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. These credentials indicate that the company adheres to industry best practices and is qualified to work in regulated environments (indeed, P&D Environmental is a registered waste carrier/broker, permitting it to handle and transport waste from dredging and site works)
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. Company Structure & Group Affiliations: P&D Environmental Ltd is part of the broader P&D Marine Group, which also encompasses related companies such as The Pontoon & Dock Company (specialists in pontoon equipment), P&D Marine Services, P&D Boats, and Multi-Mover UK
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. This group structure resulted from an internal merger and rebranding in 2021, when the Pontoon & Dock Company (founded 2009) was consolidated with its sister businesses under the P&D Marine Group umbrella
theconstructionindex.co.uk
theconstructionindex.co.uk
. The integration into P&D Marine Group allows P&D Environmental to offer “a turnkey solution” alongside its sister companies, leveraging collective expertise in marine equipment supply, material handling, and floating structures
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. The group’s philosophy, as described by management, is “offering the best solutions for any project on or near the water” and continuously improving through innovation
pandd-environmental.co.uk
theconstructionindex.co.uk
. P&D Environmental operates from the group’s main office in Bretby (Midlands) and shares access to a central warehouse facility in Shropshire for equipment and fabrication
theconstructionindex.co.uk
. As of 2025, the company is in its 13th year of operation, having been incorporated in December 2012
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
, and it markets itself as having “over a decade” of experience in its niche
pandd-environmental.co.uk
.
Financial and Legal Information
P&D Environmental Ltd is a private limited company in active status, with all statutory filings up to date
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
companycheck.co.uk
. The company’s financial filings classify it as a small or micro-enterprise. Independent business data indicates that annual turnover is under £1 million, with fewer than 10 employees in recent years
open.endole.co.uk
. In fact, Endole reports the company size as “Micro – Turnover under £1M, Balance sheet under £500K, under 10 employees”
open.endole.co.uk
. This is consistent with abbreviated accounts filed under the small company regime. Notably, P&D Environmental’s accounts (which are filed for the year ending September 30 each year) do not publicly disclose revenue figures (a common practice for small companies)
open.endole.co.uk
. However, other financial metrics are available and suggest the company operates with significant capital equipment investments and debt financing. As of the latest accounts filed (year ended 30 September 2024), the company had total assets of ~£471k and total liabilities of ~£736k, resulting in net assets of approximately -£265k (a negative equity position that increased in deficit from the previous year)
open.endole.co.uk
open.endole.co.uk
. In other words, liabilities exceeded assets, implying accumulated losses or debt-funded asset purchases. For context, in 2021 the net assets were -£237.7k
greatbusinessexchange.co.uk
greatbusinessexchange.co.uk
, so the deficit has grown, possibly due to ongoing investments in equipment or operating losses. The firm’s cash on hand in 2024 was very low (~£2.1k)
open.endole.co.uk
, down from over £100k cash a few years prior
greatbusinessexchange.co.uk
, again suggesting cash has been reinvested into the business (e.g. purchase of plant or servicing of debt). Indeed, the balance sheets show substantial fixed assets (hundreds of thousands of pounds in equipment) and the presence of bank loans/credit: a debenture charge was registered in September 2020 and a new charge in March 2025
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
, indicating the company took on secured loans (likely to finance machinery or expansion). One earlier charge from 2020 was fully satisfied by Feb 2025, and a new charge was created in March 2025
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
 – this implies refinancing or taking a new loan that year. Revenue & Profitability: Although exact revenue is unreported, the scale of operations (10 staff, specialized contracting projects) suggests annual revenues on the order of a few hundred thousand pounds (likely sufficient to support the payroll and overhead, but under £1m as noted). Historical data hints that P&D Environmental has at times operated at a loss. For example, between 2017 and 2020 the net worth improved from -£246k to -£189k
greatbusinessexchange.co.uk
greatbusinessexchange.co.uk
, implying some profitable years, but by 2024 net worth had dipped further negative. The debt-to-assets ratio is high (in 2024 debt ratio was ~156%, up from ~109% in 2023)
open.endole.co.uk
open.endole.co.uk
, which points to leveraged finances. This financial profile could affect the company’s credit rating: while we don’t have the exact credit score, a specialist credit check site would likely flag P&D Environmental as a moderate risk due to its negative equity and reliance on debt. (The credit limit any supplier might offer them would presumably be modest; a detailed credit report would take into account that the firm’s parent backing is P&D Marine Group, which may provide financial support.) Importantly, the company remains a going concern – accounts are filed under the assumption of continued operation, and the backing by the group (which took majority ownership in 2021) likely provides stability
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
. Companies House records confirm the company status is Active and accounts have been filed up to Sep 2024, with the next accounts due June 2026
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
companycheck.co.uk
. Ownership and Legal Structure: Legally, P&D Environmental Ltd is now majority-controlled by P&D Marine Group Ltd (Company No. 13079060) which was introduced as a corporate shareholder in February 2021
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
. According to the Persons with Significant Control (PSC) register, P&D Marine Group Ltd owns >50% of the shares (but <75%), giving it a controlling stake
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
. The remaining significant shareholder is Mr. Ben Jones, who retains 25–50% ownership (Ben was first noted as a PSC in 2016, suggesting he acquired equity in the company at that time)
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
. Prior to 2021, the founders Mr. Simon Nadin and Mr. Jason “Dan” Bryant each held substantial shares, but both ceased to be direct PSCs when the restructuring placed their shares under the group entity
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
. This corporate structure means P&D Environmental’s fortunes are intertwined with the group, and its financial filings note it as a “Private limited company with share capital”
companycheck.co.uk
. The company’s SIC code is 30110 (Building of ships and floating structures)
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
, a classification chosen likely because of the marine infrastructure work (floating pontoon systems, etc.) they undertake. Regulatory and Legal Compliance: P&D Environmental appears to be in good legal standing, with no public records of regulatory violations or legal disputes. A search of official sources shows no Environment Agency or HSE (Health & Safety Executive) enforcement notices against the company. On the contrary, the company proactively maintains required licenses – for example, it is a registered waste carrier/broker (registration CBDL10689, since March 2014) to legally transport and dispose of waste from its dredging and site clearance operations
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. There have been no notices in the UK Gazette for compulsory strike-off or insolvency; all confirmation statements and accounts have been filed on time
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
. Credit checks show no County Court Judgments (CCJs) against P&D Environmental as of the latest data (indicating it has not been taken to court over unpaid debts). Overall, aside from the financial risks noted (which are managed within the group), the company is compliant and operates with the proper certifications and regulatory approvals for its field.
Leadership and Management Background
The company is led by two directors who combine industry entrepreneurship with operational expertise:
Simon Nadin – Managing Director (Group CEO): Simon Nadin (whom the question refers to as “Scott Nanid” – likely a misnomer – his official name is Simon) is a co-founder of the P&D business and the driving force behind the P&D Marine Group. Simon’s background is in marine equipment and civil engineering. Notably, in 2009 he co-founded the Pontoon & Dock Company along with partner Dan Bryant
theconstructionindex.co.uk
. Over the subsequent decade, Nadin helped grow that venture from a small startup – “a small combi van, a green trailer, about ten sections of pontoon and a website” in his words – into a group of five integrated businesses and “one of the industry’s most respected suppliers”
theconstructionindex.co.uk
theconstructionindex.co.uk
. When co-founder Dan (Jason D. Bryant) retired in early 2021, Simon Nadin orchestrated a management buyout, taking full control of the business and forming P&D Marine Group Ltd
theconstructionindex.co.uk
theconstructionindex.co.uk
. He now serves as Group CEO and Managing Director of P&D Environmental Ltd. Professional profiles list him as Managing Director, based in Midway, England
wiza.co
wiza.co
. Simon’s leadership style, as gleaned from interviews, emphasizes quality and client-focused solutions – he is quoted saying “we cannot rest on our past successes and continue to strive… to provide all our clients with the very best product and service”
theconstructionindex.co.uk
. Under his tenure, the company has expanded organically and maintained a “family” ethos despite growth
theconstructionindex.co.uk
. While detailed prior career info is scarce in public sources, Simon’s hands-on experience is evident: trade articles show him directly involved in major projects. For instance, after the 2021 rebrand, he has been “at the helm” of all five business units
theconstructionindex.co.uk
. He often represents the company in media – e.g., announcing strategic partnerships (“We are delighted to announce the partnership with Excel Boats,” said Simon as P&D Marine Group CEO in Marine Industry News)
cbinsights.com
. Simon Nadin likely has qualifications and expertise in marine engineering and business management gained over ~15+ years in the industry. (His LinkedIn profile is not publicly visible, but he is identified as Managing Director of P&D Environmental on that platform
wiza.co
.) Under Simon’s leadership, P&D Environmental has navigated the merger and continues to diversify offerings, benefiting from his industry relationships with bodies like the Port of London Authority, Environment Agency, etc.
pandd-environmental.co.uk
.
Ben Jones – Contracts Director (Operations Director): Ben Jones joined P&D Environmental in its early years and has become a key figure overseeing project delivery and commercial operations. Companies House records show Ben was appointed director in May 2013
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
. His listed occupation at that time was “Marketing”
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
, suggesting he may have originally been involved in business development or commercial outreach for the young company. Over time, his role expanded; Ben is now commonly referred to as the Contracts Director for P&D Environmental
inlandandcoastal.com
. In practice, this means he manages contracting, client liaison, and on-site execution of projects. Industry publications highlight Ben’s role: for example, Inland & Coastal Marina Systems notes that “the P&D Environmental team worked closely with [our] design and site team...’ says Ben Jones, Contracts Director at P&D Environmental”
inlandandcoastal.com
 when describing a collaborative pontoon installation project. Ben often personally leads installation teams – a case study in 2024 on a Plymouth harbor project credits “our installation team, led by Ben Jones from P&D Environmental,” as a key factor for success
inlandandcoastal.com
. This indicates Ben’s hands-on project management expertise in marine construction. His professional background likely includes experience in civil engineering or construction management, given the technical nature of the works. While less is published about Ben’s prior history, the fact that he attained directorship and equity (he is a significant shareholder) by his late twenties implies a strong proficiency and commitment recognized by the founders. Ben’s LinkedIn/social presence is not heavily public-facing, but he is known in industry circles – e.g., being quoted in newsletters and credited in project briefs suggests he actively engages with clients and suppliers. In one instance, Ben described managing a tight installation window with minimal disruption at a fishing quay project, highlighting his focus on client requirements and efficient execution
inlandandcoastal.com
inlandandcoastal.com
. As of 2025, Ben Jones continues to serve as a director and is the second-largest stakeholder in the company
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk
. Internally, he likely heads operations/contracts, reporting to Simon Nadin (who as Group MD oversees strategy). The leadership dynamic appears to be Simon as the strategic leader/CEO and Ben as the operational lead ensuring projects are delivered to standard. This small leadership team is complemented by other managers in the group – for example, an Operations Manager (Derren Fisher) is listed as a colleague in company directories
wiza.co
wiza.co
, and the careers page references a Contracts Manager under Ben
pandd-environmental.co.uk
 – but Simon Nadin and Ben Jones are the primary directors steering P&D Environmental.
Both Simon and Ben maintain a relatively low-profile social media presence, typical of a small business leadership. They do appear on LinkedIn (Simon with the MD title; Ben likely similarly), and they often network via industry events (e.g., flood management expos, marine trade shows). Notably, no negative publicity or controversies are associated with either individual. Simon Nadin’s takeover of the business in 2021 was amicable (occurring upon his partner’s retirement)
theconstructionindex.co.uk
theconstructionindex.co.uk
, and it underscored continuity of leadership. The two directors bring complementary skills – entrepreneurial vision from Nadin and on-ground project management from Jones – which have allowed P&D Environmental to carve out a specialist niche in marine environmental construction.
Digital Maturity and Systems
In terms of digital maturity, P&D Environmental presents a mixed picture. On one hand, the company has a modern digital footprint for marketing and client outreach. On the other hand, operationally it appears to rely on traditional industry practices with limited evidence of advanced digital systems internally:
Website and Content Strategy: The company’s website is professional and kept up-to-date, indicating a moderate level of digital marketing maturity. The site (pandd-environmental.co.uk) is well-structured with clear navigation, and it features a “Latest News” section that effectively serves as a blog
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. P&D Environmental regularly publishes articles on relevant topics – e.g. “How Inland Waterway Management Shapes the Environment”, “The Importance of Canal Dredging in the UK”, and technical explainers like “What is a Marine Contractor?”
pandd-environmental.co.uk
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. These posts (dozens over the past couple of years) suggest a conscious SEO (Search Engine Optimization) effort: by generating content around keywords such as dredging, flood risk, marine piling, etc., the company likely aims to improve its search rankings and educate prospective clients. The presence of such content implies P&D has embraced digital marketing as a tool for business development. Indeed, the tone of the blog articles is informative and industry-focused, which can attract search traffic and reinforce the company’s expertise in marine services. This is a sign of digital maturity on the marketing front – even smaller firms in construction are increasingly using content marketing, and P&D Environmental is doing so in-house or via its group. Additionally, the website prominently features contact forms, and the company invites online inquiries, showing readiness to engage digitally with clients
pandd-environmental.co.uk
.
Social Media Presence: P&D Environmental maintains active profiles on major social platforms (LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter/X), demonstrating an understanding of the need for online engagement. The LinkedIn Company Page (listed under P&D Environmental Limited) categorizes the business in “Environmental Services” and lists 11-50 employees, which likely includes group staff
wiza.co
wiza.co
. While the exact follower count is unknown, P&D likely uses LinkedIn to share news such as project accomplishments or group announcements. On Twitter (now X), the company’s handle @PDEnvironmental is used. For example, their feed has highlighted industry involvement: “P&D Environmental are proud sponsors of WaterSafe UK…” and “We’re attending the Flood Expo this year, come visit us on stand F111” – posts which indicate they leverage social media for both corporate social responsibility (water safety advocacy) and marketing (promoting trade show attendance)
x.com
. They also announced an equipment acquisition via Twitter (hinting at sharing operational milestones with their audience)
x.com
. On Facebook, P&D Environmental Limited’s page shares project photos and company updates. One can infer the tone is approachable and community-oriented: posts include holiday greetings (e.g. wishing Merry Christmas), short project videos (#ThrowbackThursday highlights), and employee/team spotlights with reactions from staff and followers
facebook.com
. However, as a B2B contractor, their following on Facebook is modest (perhaps a few hundred likes), and engagement is likely limited – still, the consistent posting shows a commitment to online visibility. Overall, the company’s social media strategy is present but not aggressive – appropriate for a niche contractor. They use it to showcase expertise and maintain a professional image rather than to drive mass traffic.
Internal Digital Tools: When it comes to internal operations (project management, data handling, etc.), the public information is sparse. The job listings and company info do not reference any specific construction management software or digital platforms in use. For instance, job ads for a Working Marine Foreman and Yard Operative emphasize practical skills (plant operation, welding, mechanical maintenance) and certifications (CPCS cards, SMSTS/SSSTS safety training)
pandd-environmental.co.uk
pandd-environmental.co.uk
, but make no mention of IT or software proficiency
pandd-environmental.co.uk
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. This suggests that field operations are managed via traditional means (on-site supervision, paper or basic electronic records) rather than advanced digital systems like BIM (Building Information Modeling) or specialized project management software. The foreman role reports to the Contracts Director/Manager and involves “hands on” supervision
pandd-environmental.co.uk
, implying reliance on personal oversight and experience instead of tech-enabled tracking. The hiring process itself is telling: candidates are asked to “apply via email… including a CV”
pandd-environmental.co.uk
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. The use of direct email (rather than an online recruitment portal or ATS) indicates a lean, possibly paper-based administrative approach to HR.
Use of Construction Tech: There is no evidence that P&D Environmental uses cutting-edge construction management platforms (e.g., Procore, Asite, or field management mobile apps). Given the company’s size, it’s likely they coordinate projects using standard tools like Microsoft Office (Excel for project schedules, Word for reports) and email/phone for communications. Site crews probably rely on printed plans and on-site adjustments guided by experienced foremen rather than digital tablets or BIM models. The nature of their projects (often bespoke in remote outdoor environments) means high-tech solutions may be of limited incremental benefit. That said, the group does invest in digital marketing and communication, as noted above. Also, the industry context might drive some tech adoption: for example, machine control technology on excavators for dredging or using GPS for surveying waterways could be part of their toolset (not explicitly stated, but common in dredging projects to ensure accurate digging depths). Any such technology use would be project-specific rather than enterprise software.
Hiring and Growth Trends: P&D Environmental’s careers page emphasizes that the company is expanding and offers opportunities for those who “grow with the company”
pandd-environmental.co.uk
. Recent job postings for operational roles imply the company is bolstering its execution team to handle more contracts. The fact that they were recruiting a Marine Foreman and a Yard Operative in 2024
pandd-environmental.co.uk
pandd-environmental.co.uk
 suggests an increase in workload and perhaps an effort to bring more skills in-house (e.g., welding and plant maintenance in the yard, which supports digital maturity by reducing downtime). These hiring trends show moderate growth and an effort to maintain a skilled workforce, though they don’t directly reflect digital maturity.
In summary, digitally, P&D Environmental is strongest in its outward-facing activities – it has a solid website with SEO-rich content and active social media for branding. Internally, the company seems to operate in a traditional manner typical for SMEs in construction: using essential digital tools (email, standard office software) but not heavily investing in specialized construction IT systems. The company’s size and niche may not necessitate sophisticated digital platforms, and its competitive edge lies more in specialized expertise and equipment than in tech. There is also no mention of any ISO 27001 or IT certifications, so IT is likely not a focal point beyond basic needs. That said, the presence of an environmental management system (as part of ISO 14001) means they do have process documentation – possibly maintained in digital format – ensuring compliance and record-keeping for projects (e.g. method statements, risk assessments, environmental impact logs). In essence, P&D Environmental’s digital maturity could be described as “developing”: they recognize the value of digital presence and information-sharing, but their core project delivery relies on human expertise and conventional methods rather than digital transformation.
Social Media and Public Visibility
P&D Environmental’s public visibility has been gradually built through online presence, industry engagement, and search discoverability:
Website Domain & SEO Performance: The company’s domain (pandd-environmental.co.uk) has been live for many years (at least since mid-2010s) and serves as a hub for information. The website’s content strategy, as discussed, likely boosts its SEO. For example, if one searches for “marine dredging contractors UK” or related terms, P&D Environmental’s pages or blog posts may appear, thanks to keyword-optimized articles (like “Exploring the Benefits of Dredging for Managing Flood Risks”
pandd-environmental.co.uk
). While we don’t have specific analytics, the frequency of topical posts suggests the site is tuned for search ranking on niche terms. The domain authority is not published here, but given their backlinks from industry sites (e.g., Inland & Coastal’s blog referencing P&D Environmental with a hyperlink
inlandandcoastal.com
), they have some link equity. The company is also listed in various online directories (Companies House, construction directories, etc.), which improves online visibility.
Search Engine Results: Official and business directory results populate for the company name – e.g., Companies House listing, Endole, CompanyCheck, and even niche sites like Wastebook or Pomanda show up
open.endole.co.uk
pomanda.com
. This indicates that anyone searching the company will easily find its identity, status, and basic profile. The presence of these results (some of which we have cited) also adds to credibility, as they often include summaries like “P&D Environmental Ltd… active company incorporated on 20 Dec 2012… located in Burton-on-Trent”
open.endole.co.uk
open.endole.co.uk
, giving consistent info across the web. There is no evidence of negative SEO or bad press affecting search results – notably, results are relevant and neutral/positive (no scam reports or complaint sites, which is a good sign for reputation).
Social Media Engagement: On LinkedIn, P&D Environmental likely has a modest following comprising industry professionals, suppliers, and group employees. They might share case studies or group news on LinkedIn. Given the nature of their work, engagement (likes, comments) would be limited to those interested in marine construction. Facebook provides a window into more casual engagement: the company’s Facebook page (which had at least ~27 likes in one of its incarnations, possibly a separate US-based “P&D Environmental Services” – not to be confused) is used to post project photos. A Facebook snippet describes P&D as “specialising in inland marine civils, dredging, lake and river restoration, bank...”
facebook.com
, consistent with their messaging. Posts show images of their work (e.g., a jetty reconstruction on the South Coast, with P&D crews at work
facebook.com
) and often tag employees (Ben Jones and others are tagged in photos, indicating staff engagement online)
facebook.com
. The tone on Facebook is friendly and proud – celebrating achievements, wishing followers a Happy New Year with updates that “our teams are back on site completing jobs”, and using hashtags like #dredging or #ThrowbackThursday for wider reach
facebook.com
. The engagement on these posts appears modest (a few likes or shares, often by employees or partners), which is normal for a B2B contractor. Twitter (X) as mentioned is used for announcements and industry chatter. For instance, P&D’s tweet about attending Flood Expo (a major flood management exhibition) shows they are proactive in marketing to potential clients at events
x.com
. They also tweeted about sponsoring WaterSafe UK, a volunteer initiative for water safety – this not only boosts their community profile but also likely garnered some engagement or goodwill online.
Industry Publications and PR: P&D Environmental’s visibility is also boosted by being featured in industry news outlets and press releases. The Construction Index and openPR press release in March 2021 announcing the P&D Marine Group formation is one such example that got circulated
theconstructionindex.co.uk
theconstructionindex.co.uk
. Additionally, Marine Industry News covered a partnership involving the group (Excel Boats, a RIB manufacturer, partnering with P&D Marine Group) where Simon Nadin was quoted
cbinsights.com
. These articles serve both as publicity and as SEO backlinks. The company’s projects are sometimes written up by partners: for example, Inland and Coastal Marina Systems published case studies of joint projects, crediting P&D Environmental’s contributions
inlandandcoastal.com
. This kind of coverage in trade magazines and partner websites raises P&D’s profile among potential clients who read those sources. It also reinforces the company’s reputation as a competent specialist contractor through third-party validation.
Website Metrics and Domain Health: While we don’t have exact metrics, the site’s content activity up to 2025 (with a ©2025 notice on the site)
pandd-environmental.co.uk
 and the presence of the site on search results indicate the domain is healthy. The site is likely mobile-friendly and uses a builder (there are references to Wix static content in the code, suggesting it might be built on a user-friendly platform)
static.wixstatic.com
. Page load speeds and design seem adequate. Having regularly updated content (news posts almost monthly) means search engines will crawl the site often, aiding its ranking. The SEO performance can be qualitatively judged as good for a company of its size and niche – they appear to invest effort into it, which not all small contractors do.
Public Engagement Tone: On all platforms, P&D Environmental maintains a professional yet approachable tone. They highlight safety and quality in projects, celebrate team efforts, and respond to industry trends (like discussing environmental benefits of their work in blog posts). They do not engage in controversial topics; communication is focused on their services, achievements, and occasionally community involvement.
Networking and Visibility: The company also gains visibility through exhibitions and sponsorships. Attending the Flood Expo, for instance, puts them in front of stakeholders in flood risk management (a relevant field for dredging and watercourse services). Sponsoring WaterSafe UK aligns them with promoting safety in plumbing and water (WaterSafe is a plumbing assurance scheme), perhaps to network in the broader water industry. These actions, while not massive in scale, show savvy in building a brand identity associated with safety and expertise.
In summary, P&D Environmental’s public visibility is robust relative to its size. It leverages digital channels (website, social media) and industry platforms to stay on the radar of potential clients and partners. The consistency of its messaging across these channels – emphasizing its marine and environmental specialization – reinforces its niche brand. The engagement levels are not viral by any means, but the targeted audience is being reached. Importantly, there’s no negative public commentary easily found – a search yields no bad reviews or complaints. The company has effectively managed its online reputation to remain positive or neutral, which is crucial for client trust in B2B services.
Customer Feedback and Reputation
Customer feedback for P&D Environmental appears to be largely positive, albeit typically shared in industry contexts rather than on public review sites. Being a B2B contractor, the company doesn’t have a presence on consumer review platforms like Yelp or Trustpilot, and its small size means it hasn’t accumulated reviews on Glassdoor or Indeed from employees (there is no record of any Glassdoor reviews, likely due to having ~10 staff which is below the threshold for anonymous reviews to appear). Instead, testimonials and client sentiments are found in project case studies and partner references:
Client Testimonials in Case Studies: P&D Environmental has been praised by clients for effective project execution. For instance, in a newsletter about a Hartlepool Harbour pontoon installation, the General Manager of the Fish Quay client is quoted expressing strong satisfaction: “It was vital that both our supplier and contractor worked hand in hand… This worked well and we are really pleased with the result... the project was run smoothly and efficiently, and communication was second to none throughout the works, we would happily recommend them for further works.”

. This testimonial (from Fishco’s manager) highlights P&D’s cooperative approach, minimal disruption to the client’s operations, and high-quality outcome – concluding with a clear willingness to rehire or recommend P&D Environmental
inlandandcoastal.com
. Such a statement, published in a third-party newsletter, is a strong endorsement of the company’s service and client relations.
Successful Project Outcomes: Additional client feedback can be inferred from project outcomes. In the Plymouth Barbican pontoons project, the Deputy Harbour Master commented positively on the entire team (including P&D) for completing the job within a tight 10-day window: “the whole team’s ‘can do’ approach enabled the entire project to be assembled within a tight 10-day window.”
inlandandcoastal.com
 Although this quote was attributed to the supplier, it implies that P&D Environmental’s team (led by Ben Jones on-site) demonstrated excellent project management and flexibility, which pleased the client (Cattewater Harbour Commissioners). The tone of these comments is appreciative – focusing on P&D’s professionalism, efficiency, and communication. This indicates a reputation for reliability in delivering specialized projects.
Direct Customer Reviews: There is no known presence of P&D Environmental on public review forums for contractors (no Google Reviews visible, no BuildZoom or Checkatrade style reviews that pertain to the UK company – note that search results for “P&D Environmental Services” with reviews are actually about a different company in the U.S.). The absence of public complaints is in itself a positive sign. Clients of P&D are typically organizations (councils, waterways authorities, private estates), who are more likely to provide feedback through repeat business or references rather than posting online reviews. Given the company’s continued stream of projects and its decade-long existence, we can infer a satisfactory client retention and referral rate. Many of their projects come via tender or networks in the marine sector; P&D’s inclusion in frameworks like Constructionline Gold and British Marine Federation helps assure new clients of their credibility.
Engagement with Customers/Public: On social media, P&D Environmental engages with a friendly tone. For example, they responded to the public by posting a time-lapse or photos of a dredging project and explaining its benefits, which educates and sets a positive narrative. Comments on such posts (where visible) tend to be supportive or curious about the work. The company’s responses (if any) are polite and informative, reflecting a conscientious approach to public queries. They also handle seasonal greetings and thanks publicly, e.g., thanking partners or wishing clients well at year-end – indicating a personable corporate persona.
Employee Sentiment: While not explicitly asked, it’s worth noting that internal sentiment (from what can be gathered externally) seems positive. The company speaks of growing “in parallel with [employees’] personal ambitions”
pandd-environmental.co.uk
, suggesting a culture that values staff development. There are no known negative remarks from former employees in the public domain. The retention of Ben Jones from a junior role to directorship and the hiring of new roles hint that the workplace may be rewarding and engaging, albeit very hands-on. If any Glassdoor reviews existed, they might mention the familial atmosphere of a small team and the unique nature of the work (but as noted, none are published that we could find).
Reputation in the Industry: Within their niche, P&D Environmental has built a reputable name. Being entrusted with projects in sensitive environments (SSSIs, historic canal restoration)
pandd-environmental.co.uk
pandd-environmental.co.uk
 suggests regulators and clients trust them to do careful work. Their group’s tagline as a “One Stop Solution” in marinas and water-based engineering
pandd-environmental.co.uk
 further positions them as experienced specialists rather than generalists. There is evidence that P&D is repeatedly involved with certain clients or regions – for example, they’ve done multiple projects with Inland & Coastal Marina Systems (who repeatedly mention working “closely” with P&D)
inlandandcoastal.com
inlandandcoastal.com
. Repeat collaboration like this indicates consistent performance and good working relationships with partners.
Overall, customer sentiment toward P&D Environmental is positive and characterized by trust in their expertise. Clients highlight the company’s professionalism, communication, and ability to deliver under challenging conditions
inlandandcoastal.com
. No negative feedback is documented publicly, which is somewhat rare – it implies P&D has managed their projects and client expectations well. The tone of engagement, whether in testimonials or on social media, is constructive and solution-oriented. This aligns with the company’s own stated focus on “high quality, high value, and professional services… to satisfy the needs of our valued clients.”

 In essence, P&D Environmental enjoys a solid reputation in its field, supported by specialized credentials and happy clients, and it actively works to maintain that reputation through transparent communication and adherence to industry standards. Sources:

Expert Intelligence Report: P & D Environmental Ltd (08337862) and Directors Ben Jones and Simon Nadin
I. Executive Summary and Strategic Risk Assessment
This report provides a comprehensive corporate and biographical intelligence profile for P & D Environmental Ltd (Company No. 08337862) and its key principals, Ben Jones and Simon Nadin. The analysis integrates statutory filings, operational scope, and digital footprint, highlighting the company’s position within the P&D Marine Group and identifying critical information gaps necessary for complete due diligence.

A. Core Findings and Key Intelligence
P & D Environmental Ltd (08337862) is a stable, 12-year-old, active UK private limited company incorporated on 20 December 2012. The company is positioned as a specialized contractor focusing on high-value, niche environmental services, primarily water-based civil engineering.   

Key findings regarding corporate structure and key personnel are summarized below:

Operational Specialization: The company’s expertise lies in high-barrier-to-entry work, including de-silting, marine piling, and restoration projects within sensitive environments such as Sites of Specialist Scientific Interest (SSSI) and conservation areas.   

Corporate Affiliation and Control: P & D Environmental Ltd is an integral component of the P&D Marine Group. The controlling interest (Person with Significant Control, or PSC) is officially held by P&D Marine Group Ltd.   

Fiscal Activity: Despite its micro-entity status (Turnover under £1M, under 10 employees) , the company shows active capital management. It recently satisfied a prior corporate charge in February 2025 and simultaneously registered a new, outstanding charge in March 2025.   

Key Personnel Roles: Simon Nadin (Born 1968) serves as the primary mutual director, linking and controlling the core operations of all P&D Marine Group entities, indicating centralized strategic oversight. Ben Jones (Born 1984) is a long-serving Director, appointed in May 2013, whose role is specified as Marketing.   

B. Strategic Risk Matrix and Contextual Assessment
The statutory profile of P & D Environmental Ltd presents a contradiction that warrants deeper analysis of the controlling group structure. The classification of the company as a micro-entity, restricted to under £1 million in turnover and fewer than ten employees , stands in sharp contrast to the sophisticated, capital-intensive services it offers, such as sheet piling, specialized diving, and the use of custom-built marine plant.   

This disparity strongly indicates a deliberate corporate strategy: P & D Environmental Ltd operates primarily as the specialized contracting and regulatory interface entity, while the core financial liabilities, significant assets, and heavy-duty plant machinery are likely held and financed by the associated P&D Marine Group entities, which are centrally connected by Simon Nadin. This governance model serves to streamline the operational focus of the environmental arm while potentially shielding it from the full financial disclosure requirements and liabilities associated with the group’s heavy asset base. Comprehensive due diligence must therefore extend to the solvency and structure of the entire P&D Marine Group.   

Furthermore, the recent fiscal activity—satisfying an older debt and immediately incurring a new outstanding charge —is a strong indicator of active asset financing. This suggests a capital expenditure cycle, possibly related to the renewal or acquisition of new specialized marine plant necessary for maintaining its competitive edge in complex environmental contracts. While this activity represents a liability, the concurrent satisfaction of the prior charge suggests controlled capital management rather than fiscal distress.   

Metric	P & D Environmental Ltd (08337862)	Ben Jones (Director)	Simon Nadin (Director)
Status	Active (Incorporated Dec 2012)	Role: Marketing Director/PSC	Role: Group Principal/Mutual Director
Financial Profile	Micro Entity (Turnover < £1M)	Appointed: 1 May 2013	Central Figure linking all P&D Group entities
Current Liabilities	One Outstanding Charge (March 2025)	Born: Dec 1984 (c. 41 yrs)	Born: Nov 1968 (c. 57 yrs)
Known Gaps	Education, Independent Financial Detail	Education: UNAVAILABLE	Education: UNAVAILABLE
II. Corporate Profile: Statutory and Financial Analysis (08337862)
A. Statutory Identity and Regulatory Standing
P & D Environmental Ltd is formally identified by the UK Companies House number 08337862. The entity holds Active status, having been incorporated on 20 December 2012. The company maintains strong administrative stability, retaining its registered office address at Repton House, Bretby Business Park, Burton-On-Trent, Staffordshire, DE15 0YZ, for the past nine years.   

It is essential to strictly exclude all references to similar entities that are not the target UK business. Specifically, information pertaining to "P & D Environmental Inc." , which appears in external searches related to US-based safety consulting and the Better Business Bureau (BBB), is not relevant to the UK private limited company under review.   

B. Companies House Filing Analysis and Compliance History
The company maintains a consistent record of statutory compliance. Filings show that P & D Environmental Ltd adheres to all regulatory deadlines, regularly submitting its total exemption full accounts and confirmation statements. The confirmation statement made on 20 November 2024 is due for renewal on 20 November 2025.   

There was a notable concentration of regulatory activity between late 2024 and mid-2025. This includes changes to the Person with Significant Control (PSC) details for P&D Marine Group Ltd in November 2024 , and significant activity regarding corporate charges in the first quarter of 2025. Director details for both Mr. Ben Jones and Mr. Simon Nadin were previously changed in December 2022. This pattern of regulatory updates and fiscal movement suggests a period of strategic alignment or high operational momentum within the group.   

C. Financial Status, Disclosure, and Gearing Assessment
P & D Environmental Ltd is classified as a micro-entity, as indicated by its total exemption full accounts submissions. This classification restricts the public availability of detailed financial data, confirming the company operates with a turnover under £1 million, a balance sheet total under £500,000, and fewer than ten employees. The next accounts for the period ending 30 September 2025 are due by 30 June 2026.   

The company’s recent charge history is critical for assessing its current financial obligations and capital investment strategy:

The previous charge (Charge code 0833 7862 0001), created in September 2020, was recorded as satisfied in full on 12 February 2025. Less than a month later, a new charge (Charge code 0833 7862 0002) was registered on 7 March 2025, and remains outstanding.   

This sequential pattern—the repayment of an older liability followed almost immediately by the acquisition of a new liability—suggests controlled, deliberate capital management. This behaviour is highly characteristic of businesses in capital-intensive sectors, such as marine civil engineering, that utilize revolving credit facilities or asset financing to acquire or renew specialized, high-value assets (such as barges or custom-built marine plant) required for its specialized project work. The simultaneous management of debt indicates confidence in current or projected cash flow and operational stability.   

P & D Environmental Ltd Corporate Charges History (08337862)

Charge Code	Creation Date	Delivery Date	Satisfaction Date	Status	Source
0833 7862 0002	06 March 2025	07 March 2025	N/A	Outstanding	
0833 7862 0001	29 September 2020	29 September 2020	12 February 2025	Satisfied	
  
III. Operational Scope and Market Positioning
A. Specialized Services Portfolio
P & D Environmental Ltd operates within a specialized niche, offering a comprehensive suite of marine and environmental contracting services.   

The core focus is on water-based civil engineering services, including:

Restoration and Management: De-silting, lake and river restoration, and river/watercourse management.   

Structural Works: Bank stabilisation, rock armour and scour protection, sheet piling, culvert installation/repair, retaining wall construction/refurbishment, and structural underpinning.   

Infrastructure: Jetty and pier construction and refurbishment, outfall construction, and flood defences (construction and repair).   

Specialized Techniques: The company utilizes bio-engineering techniques  and offers specialized diving services, including underwater surveys, ROV inspections, installing grout matters, and underwater cutting and welding.   

B. Regulatory Competence and High-Barrier-to-Entry Market
The company’s ability to work on highly sensitive and complex projects is a key differentiator in its market positioning. P & D Environmental Ltd explicitly markets its expertise in operating within Sites of Specialist Scientific Interest (SSSI) and other conservation areas, as well as its involvement in restoring Historic Structures along waterways.   

Working within SSSI environments requires advanced regulatory compliance, specialized permits, bespoke planning, and meticulous environmental management protocols. The fact that the company successfully undertakes this work validates its claims of high quality and professionalism. Furthermore, the company highlights its use of custom-built plant and the ability to operate from land or afloat, which is necessary to access sites with environmental sensitivity or restricted access. This operational versatility and proven regulatory competence constitute a significant competitive advantage.   

IV. The P&D Marine Group Structure and Control Dynamics
A. Group Affiliation and Corporate Integration
P & D Environmental Ltd functions as one operational segment of the broader P&D Marine Group. The legal structure confirms P&D Marine Group Ltd as the Person with Significant Control (PSC) over the environmental contracting entity.   

The group structure is highly integrated, allowing P & D Environmental Ltd to draw resources and support from its associated companies :   

The Pontoon And Dock Company Ltd

P & D Marine Services Ltd

P&D Boats

P&D Multimover Ltd

B. Cross-Directorships and Centralized Control (Simon Nadin)
The operational efficiency and structural integrity of the P&D Marine Group are highly dependent on the central role of Simon Nadin. He is identified as the "mutual person" linked across all the core active entities, including The Pontoon And Dock Company Ltd, P & D Marine Services Ltd, and P&D Multimover Ltd.   

This widespread directorship confirms Nadin’s role as the overarching strategic and operational leader for the group. He manages the allocation of heavy assets (likely via P&D Multimover Ltd), core services (P&D Marine Services Ltd), and specialized infrastructure (The Pontoon And Dock Company Ltd) to support the niche projects undertaken by P & D Environmental Ltd. This centralized model ensures streamlined decision-making and optimal resource deployment across the complex, asset-intensive business lines. However, this structure simultaneously concentrates substantial operational and succession risk onto a single individual.

V. Director Profile: Ben Jones
A. Statutory Record and Profile
Mr. Ben Jones is a founding figure in the company, having been appointed as an Active Director on 1 May 2013, shortly after the company’s incorporation. His statutory profile records him as British, residing in England, and born in December 1984. His stated occupation is Marketing. Jones is also listed as a Person with Significant Control (PSC) in the company, confirming a significant stake or voting power. His correspondence address is listed as 35 Edinburgh Road, Church Gresley, Swadlincote, England, DE11 9GD.   

B. Role within the P&D Marine Group and Control Status
Jones’s function as Marketing Director is crucial for sustaining the company’s revenue stream by securing the high-value environmental contracts that require specialized accreditation and competitive tendering. His status as a PSC alongside the corporate PSC (P&D Marine Group Ltd) establishes him as a principal stakeholder, responsible for the external representation and business development of the environmental arm, working in tandem with Simon Nadin’s focus on internal operations and asset management.

C. Exclusion of Conflicting Data (Verification)
It is critical to note that public records show information regarding a separate individual named Ben Jones (born 1982, US-based Director of Finance at Boston Scientific Corp.). This profile is strictly excluded from the assessment, as the director of P & D Environmental Ltd is specifically identified by the birth month/year of December 1984, British nationality, UK residency, and occupation as Marketing.   

D. Crucial Information Deficiency: Education History
A key requirement of the exhaustive inquiry was to determine the educational history ("where they went to school") of the directors. Based on available statutory records, the specific educational background, including school or university attendance, for Mr. Ben Jones is not available. This absence is a common feature in UK public business registries unless a director elects to disclose such details in supplementary profiles.   

VI. Director Profile: Simon Nadin
A. Statutory Record and Profile
Mr. Simon Nadin is a key Director within the structure of P & D Environmental Ltd, recorded as British and residing in the UK, born in November 1968. A Director’s details change was filed for him on 6 December 2022.   

B. Interpretation of Group Leadership
As established, Simon Nadin is the executive figure who links and manages all active specialized entities within the P&D Marine Group. This executive reach confirms his status as the group principal, responsible for operational execution and the strategic oversight of complex marine, docking, and environmental contracting activities. Given the technical nature of the projects the group undertakes—requiring specialized plant and deep competence in civil engineering and marine operations—it is highly probable that Nadin possesses substantial technical or operational expertise, even though his formal occupation is not explicitly stated in the public statutory records.   

C. Crucial Information Deficiency: Education History
Similar to his co-director, the exhaustive search for the educational history of Mr. Simon Nadin, including specific school or university attendance, did not yield results from the available public statutory data. This represents an acknowledged gap in the biographical intelligence gathered.   

VII. Market Perception and Digital Footprint
A. Digital Channel Mapping (Marketing Strategy)
The company maintains a strong official digital presence, reflecting the specialized marketing focus under Ben Jones’s direction. Its official website, pandd-environmental.co.uk, serves as the primary information hub, detailing its service portfolio, contact information (Tel: +44 (0)1283 762446; Email: sales@pandd-environmental.co.uk), and listing its accreditations and experience with SSSI sites.   

The company also integrates its communications across three major social media platforms :   

LinkedIn (Typically used for professional networking and corporate updates)

Facebook

Twitter

The consistent maintenance of these official channels allows P & D Environmental Ltd to effectively control its public narrative and present a unified, professional image to its clients and partners.

B. Assessment of Customer Reviews and Independent Sentiment
Objective assessment of independent customer sentiment for P & D Environmental Ltd is challenged by the company’s business model. Operating in the B2B sector of specialized environmental contracting means the company does not typically solicit or receive feedback on general public review sites.

Unavailable Independent Data: No readily available, verifiable customer reviews or comprehensive third-party ratings were found for the UK entity (08337862).

Irrelevant Data: Any information found on platforms such as the BBB profile for "P & D Environmental Inc."  is geographically and organizationally irrelevant to the UK operation and must be dismissed.   

Controlled Feedback: The only public feedback available consists of positive testimonials (e.g., describing service as "Efficient, reliable, knowledgeable, enthusiastic" ) presented on the corporate website or affiliated pages. While positive, these internal endorsements lack the verification necessary for objective risk assessment.   

VIII. Conclusions, Data Gaps, and Future Research Directives
A. Summary of Corporate Stability and Control
P & D Environmental Ltd is demonstrably a structurally sound and regulatory compliant entity. Its strength does not derive solely from its individual balance sheet (limited by its micro-entity status) but from its strategic integration within the larger P&D Marine Group. The company has secured a specialized, high-margin market position by focusing on challenging environmental and marine civil engineering projects. Strategic control is highly concentrated in the hands of Simon Nadin, who orchestrates group assets, while Ben Jones drives market acquisition. The recent financial activity suggests a stable, proactive approach to capital management, indicative of ongoing investment in operational assets.

B. Formal Documentation of Critical Data Gaps
The investigation reveals two principal limitations in achieving an "exhaustive" report based on public records:

Educational History: The specific schooling, university attendance, or professional qualifications of both Ben Jones (Born 1984) and Simon Nadin (Born 1968) remain undisclosed in all statutory and public professional records reviewed.

Financial Granularity: Detailed financial performance metrics, including comprehensive profit and loss statements and a full breakdown of the balance sheet, are legally withheld due to the company's micro-entity classification.

C. Recommendations for Exhaustive Fulfillment
To achieve a complete and exhaustive intelligence profile, further deep-dive research is required, focusing on proprietary and industry-specific data sources:

Fiscal Transparency: Immediate retrieval and analysis of the instrument related to the outstanding corporate Charge 083378620002. This will identify the exact collateral secured and the financing value, allowing for a precise quantification of the company's recent capital investment and current gearing ratio.

Biographical Inference: Utilize advanced biographical tools to cross-reference the directors' names against trade registers, industry bodies (e.g., civil engineering or maritime professional associations), and specialized UK industry media. This approach may indirectly reveal professional affiliations or published works that substitute for formal educational records.

Operational Validation: Conduct focused searches on the P&D Marine Group entities and their projects in UK regional and trade publications. Securing third-party evidence of specific project successes (e.g., confirmation of SSSI site work completion) will provide the necessary independent validation of their high-quality claims.

I. Analysis of Financial Statements (30 September 2024 Accounts)
Review of both the original (June 2025) and amended (July 2025) accounts for the year ended 30 September 2024 confirms the financial position is identical in both filings, with the only noted difference being the correction of the registered office address.   

A. Core Financial Position: Increased Negative Equity

The company's financial health as of September 30, 2024, reveals a deepening negative equity position, meaning the company's total liabilities significantly exceed its total assets:

Net Liabilities (Negative Shareholders' Funds): The company reported net liabilities of £264,673 in 2024, a substantial decline from £67,857 in 2023. This indicates a net loss of approximately £196,816 during the financial year, confirming the company is trading with a substantial deficit in capital.   

Net Current Liabilities (Working Capital): The company's short-term financial distress worsened, with Net Current Liabilities nearly doubling from £157,856 in 2023 to £335,937 in 2024. This widening gap suggests immediate pressure on working capital and liquidity.   

Asset Decline: Tangible Fixed Assets (Plant, Machinery, Motor Vehicles) decreased from £253,678 in 2023 to £163,705 in 2024, reflecting depreciation and/or disposals.   

Debtors Reduction: Trade debtors fell sharply from £284,987 in 2023 to £109,274 in 2024, which could reflect more efficient collection or a decrease in revenues.   

B. Going Concern and Group Dependency

The Directors explicitly acknowledge the financial strain, noting the accounts are prepared on a Going Concern basis, relying on the "continued support of the bank and directors".   

The financial structure confirms deep dependency on related P&D Marine Group companies:

Directors' Loans: Both directors have provided the company with loans: Simon Nadin (£1,093) and Ben Jones (£4,000). These are unsecured, interest-free, and repayable on demand.   

Intercompany Debt: The company owes significant funds to other group entities: The Pontoon & Dock Company Ltd is owed £297,397 (down from £349,227), and P & D Multimover Ltd is owed £19,039. These balances confirm the initial assessment that the P&D Marine Group provides substantial financing and operational support to P & D Environmental Ltd.   

II. Analysis of Outstanding Corporate Charge (MR01, 0833 7862 0002)
The new charge registered in March 2025, which was identified as a critical data gap, has now been fully characterized:

A. Lender and Scope of Security

Chargee (Lender): The finance provider is BIBBY FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED. Bibby Financial Services is acting as a Security Trustee for itself and other affiliated "Bibby Companies".   

Nature of Liability: The Debenture is entered into for securing further advances and encompasses all present and future liabilities of P & D Environmental Ltd to Bibby. This structure is characteristic of flexible financing arrangements such as invoice factoring or asset-based lending.   

Negative Pledge: The charge contains a negative pledge, restricting the company from creating any other security interest over the charged assets without the lender's consent.   

B. Collateral Secured

The security instrument grants the lender a very broad claim over the company’s assets:

Fixed Charge: The fixed charge explicitly covers:

All Land (freehold, leasehold, immovable property).   

All buildings, fixtures, and crucially, fixed plant and machinery.   

All Non-Vesting Debts (debts intended for factoring) and Other Debts (all present and future book debts).   

Floating Charge: A floating charge covers all the property or undertaking of the company that is not subject to a fixed charge.   

Conclusion on Financial Gearing: The outstanding charge with Bibby Financial Services Limited  is an over-arching security arrangement designed to ensure the lender has first claim over almost all of the company's critical working assets (its receivables/debts and fixed plant) and its future business. This confirms the initial hypothesis of active, asset-based financing but reveals the company is highly leveraged and reliant on the ongoing support of both its group companies and this external financial facility to continue operations.
