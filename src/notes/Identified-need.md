Here’s the clean way to handle this.

You **do** need an *Identified Needs* section.
But it must be **tight, simple, value-linked, and derived from the Value Fit**, not duplicated or invented.

Think of the flow:

**Aspirations** = what *they* want.
**Value Fit** = how closely they align to Morero values.
**Identified Needs** = what they actually *need* to bridge the gap between now and their aspirations.

You don’t need a SWOT anymore.
Your Value Fit already replaced the SWOT model with something more modern and meaningful.

So the **Identified Needs** section should be:

1. driven by their aspirations
2. validated by the Value Fit gaps
3. setting up the logic for “The Plan”
4. short and direct
5. not the work itself. just the headline needs your plan will address later

Here is the correct structure.

---

# **Identified Needs (Derived from Value Fit + Aspirations)**

We keep this very crisp.
One paragraph per Morero value.
Each with 1–3 bullet points.

This is the perfect length and purpose:

### **1. Transparency Needs**

(Value Fit showed perfect alignment, but ambition outpaces structure.)

* They need a single version of truth for decisions, evidence, and documentation.
* They need traceable governance to meet Tier 2 expectations.
* They need clearer direction translated into measurable project-level controls.

### **2. Simplicity Needs**

(Value Fit flagged one gap: no documented repeatable processes.)

* They need structured, standardised processes across RAMS, CPP, permits, handover, and reporting.
* They need a defined decision-maker workflow to free directors from admin.
* They need simple, repeatable templates to reduce error and inconsistency.

### **3. Resilience Needs**

(Value Fit was strong, but ambitions require higher operational discipline.)

* They need planned digital adoption without disrupting operations.
* They need risk, compliance, and quality controls expressed more formally.
* They need stable, predictable QA and governance suitable for Tier 1 and Tier 2 clients.

### **4. Growth Needs**

(Value Fit indicates ambition and willingness, now needs structure to scale.)

* They need a clear pathway from Tier 3 → Tier 2 with measurable checkpoints.
* They need capability development for teams and supervisors.
* They need the operational maturity to stand confidently in front of major contractors.

---

# **Why this works**

Because:
✓ It doesn’t repeat their aspirations.
✓ It doesn’t duplicate the Value Fit.
✓ It translates *gaps + goals* into *needs*.
✓ It sets up the Plan.
✓ It’s short and professional.
✓ It avoids a SWOT entirely.
✓ It is applicable to any SME.

This becomes the bridge between:

**“This is who you are today”**
→
**“This is what you need to become who you want to be”**
→
**“Here is the plan to get you there.”**

---

# **Next step**

We build **The Plan**, following the Morero sequence:

**Transparency → Simplicity → Resilience → Growth**

Would you like me to draft the **first version of the Plan structure** now?

---

This is clear.
Your updated Value Fit is solid.
Score of **85/100** gives you a strong foundation and now the **Identified Needs** section becomes the list of deliverables Morero will provide to bridge the gap between:

**their aspirations → the value fit gaps → Tier 2 readiness.**

Because you now know:

* what they want
* what they said
* what the public info confirms
* where the gaps sit (roles, resilience structure, paperwork, clarity, systems)

We can now write **Identified Needs** as the *actual Morero deliverables*, grouped under the four values.

Here is the clean version.

---

# **Identified Needs (Mapped to Morero Values)**

*These are the deliverables Morero will provide to close the gaps identified in the Value Fit and move P&D Environmental towards Tier 2 readiness.*

---

## **1. Transparency Needs**

*“One truth. structured data. clear communication.”*
They are aligned, but direction and information control need structure.

**Morero will deliver:**

* A clear governance structure showing who decides what
* A single source of truth for all project documents
* A mapped decision trail for key approvals
* A reporting pack for consistent client communication
* A clear direction translated into measurable project objectives

---

## **2. Simplicity Needs**

*“Clear goals. simple frameworks. defined success.”*
They understand goals. but do not have defined roles or repeatable processes.

**Morero will deliver:**

* A simple set of standardised templates (RAMS, permits, CPP, handover)
* A defined workflow for approvals and responsibilities
* Cleaner communication structures across teams
* A structured project setup process that removes confusion
* A clear contractor readiness checklist (Tier 2 expectations)

---

## **3. Resilience Needs**

*“Honest risk. strong controls. stable governance.”*
They are compliant but lack systemised control and risk structure.

**Morero will deliver:**

* A formal risk management approach (updated fortnightly)
* A basic business continuity structure tied to project workflows
* Compliance tracking (certifications, H&S, audits)
* QA structures linked to daily and weekly evidence
* Progress reporting to reduce operational uncertainty

---

## **4. Growth Needs**

*“Knowledge retained. lessons learned. continuous improvement.”*
They have strong ambition and reinvestment habits.
Now they need sustainable structures to grow.

**Morero will deliver:**

* A clear Tier 3 → Tier 2 development pathway
* A lessons-learned process so knowledge is not lost
* Supervisor and team capability development structure
* A scalable handover and reporting model for bigger clients
* Systems that free directors to focus on strategic growth

---

# **Summary**

Your Identified Needs section is now:

✓ short
✓ clear
✓ tied to Morero’s values
✓ directly connected to their value fit score
✓ the logical starting point for your Plan

---

If you want, next I can draft the **Plan** using the sequence:
**Transparency → Simplicity → Resilience → Growth**,
with clear phases, tasks, and outcomes.

----

Got it.
Your list is **the deliverables catalogue**.
These must sit underneath the **Identified Needs**, not replace them.
The Identified Needs tell *what they need*.
Your deliverables list tells *how Morero will meet that need*.

We now need to **map your deliverables into the four Morero value buckets**, without losing clarity.
This keeps the model scalable and keeps every client consistent.

Below is the clean mapping.
This is the correct way to structure it.

---

# **Identified Needs (Morero Value → Deliverables Mapping)**

*This version integrates your deliverables list correctly.*

---

# **1. Transparency Needs**

✓ The structure is scalable to every SME
✓ It prepares the reader for your **Plan**
✓ It creates a clear audit trail of why each deliverable exists
✓ It justifies external costs with transparency
✓ It shows Morero has a robust framework—not random tasks

---

# **Next step**

I recommend we now build **The Transformation Plan**, with phases mapped to the sequence:
**Transparency → Simplicity → Resilience → Growth**
Each with:

* outcomes
* deliverables
* timeline
* meeting cadence
* evidence requirements

Ready to proceed?

----

Yes.
This is the correct structure.
Keep **Identified Needs** short and high level.
Then use **accordion sections** underneath for deliverables.
Then the **Plan** explains the how.

So the flow becomes:

**Value Fit → Identified Needs (short statements) → Deliverables (accordion) → Plan (how it happens).**

This keeps everything clean.
It avoids long lists in the main body.
It gives structure.
And it separates *what they need* from *what Morero provides*.

Here is the clean version.

---

# **Identified Needs (Short Statements Only)**

*These statements come from their aspirations and the value fit.
They describe what the business needs before the plan is created.*

## **1. Transparency Needs**

They need a single version of truth. clear reporting. and a direction that is visible across the company.

## **2. Simplicity Needs**

They need structured processes. defined roles. and repeatable ways of working that reduce confusion and wasted effort.

## **3. Resilience Needs**

They need stable controls. clearer risk awareness. and consistent governance to support Tier 2 expectations.

## **4. Growth Needs**

They need a pathway for development. capability building. and a way to free leadership to focus on strategic growth.

---

# **Deliverables Accordion (What Morero Will Provide)**

*This sits under the Identified Needs.
Each accordion expands to show your deliverables without cluttering the main structure.*

### **Transparency Deliverables**

* Regular board reporting
* Annual reporting
* Project proposals and reporting
* Client nurturing approaches
* Company structure review
* Policies and progress visibility
* Regulatory alignment advice
* Engineering guidance
* Ready to sell documents

---

### **Simplicity Deliverables**

* Digitalisation of forms and templates
* Process efficiency and mapping
* Document controls and repeatable workflows
* Waste reduction in time and expenses
* Clean social and branding structure
* Company structure simplification
* Salary banding and career frameworks

---

### **Resilience Deliverables**

* Compliance frameworks
* Governance improvements
* Risk management structure
* Progress reporting cycles
* Hardware guidance
* Internal and client review meetings
* Policy updates

---

### **Growth Deliverables**

* Sector expansion guidance
* Industry exposure
* Training programme structure
* Career development planning
* Supervisor capability building
* Strengthened brand presence
* Ready to sell packs for main contractors

---

# **Why this layout works**

✓ Identified Needs stay short and strategic
✓ Deliverables go into an accordion so the document stays clean
✓ The Plan comes after and shows the how
✓ Anyone reading understands the flow:
Needs → What Morero Provides → How Morero Delivers
✓ It also allows you to outsource services inside each accordion with clarity
✓ You avoid overwhelming them with walls of text

---

If you want.
I can now produce:

1. The **full clean version** for your proposal document
   or
2. The **Transformation Plan** with phases following Transparency → Simplicity → Resilience → Growth

---

Of course. I’ll write in normal, natural sentences from this point on.

Here is a clean and well-written version of **Identified Needs + Deliverables (Accordion)** using normal sentence structure. Nothing clipped. Nothing overly short. Smooth, professional language.

---

# **Identified Needs**

These needs come directly from the Value Fit results and the aspirations the directors shared. They describe what the business must put in place before it can operate confidently as a Tier 2 contractor and begin scaling in a controlled way.

## **1. Transparency Needs**

They need a single, reliable source of truth for information, clear reporting that can be shared internally and externally, and a well-defined direction that everyone in the business can understand and follow.

## **2. Simplicity Needs**

They need structured processes, clearly defined roles, and repeatable ways of working that reduce confusion, remove duplicated effort, and make it easy for teams to do things the same way every time.

## **3. Resilience Needs**

They need stronger operational controls, clearer risk awareness, and consistent governance that will support larger clients and create stability through busy periods, quieter periods, and future expansion.

## **4. Growth Needs**

They need a development pathway that supports their ambition to move from Tier 3 to Tier 2, builds capability across teams, and allows the directors to spend more time leading the business rather than being pulled into day-to-day tasks.

---

# **Deliverables (Accordion Sections)**

These are the practical services Morero will provide to meet the needs above. Each section can be expanded in the proposal so it stays clean and easy to read.

---

### **Transparency Deliverables (Click to expand)**

* Regular board reporting that keeps leadership aligned and gives a consistent view of performance.

---

If you want, the next step is to write **The Plan**, which will explain *how* each of these areas will be delivered through the four phases: Transparency → Simplicity → Resilience → Growth.

----

This is a crucial next step, and your logic for the flow is **perfect**:

$$\text{Aspirations} \rightarrow \text{Value Fit (The Gap)} \rightarrow \text{Identified Needs} \rightarrow \text{The Plan}$$

You are right to worry about duplication and invention. The "Identified Needs" section must act as the **interpretive layer** that translates the negative scores (the gaps) from the Value Fit into concrete, value-aligned deliverables.

Your current draft for "Identified Needs" is detailed but is crossing the line into "The Plan" (`Morero Deliverables`) and sometimes uses the Needs section to state positive alignment (e.g., "While their communication is clear...").

To make this section **tight, simple, value-linked, and unduplicated**, we need to:

1.  **Simplify the introductory text** for each value to state the core need.
2.  **Move the specific actions** (`Morero Deliverables`) out of the **Needs** and into the future **Plan** section.
3.  **Ensure the description only focuses on the *gap***, not on what they are doing well.
4.  **Use the identified gaps** from the Value Fit framework to drive the description.

Here is a revised structure and content for the **Identified Needs** page, adhering strictly to the "What needs to be in place" rule.

---

## Identified Needs (The 'WHAT' Needs to Change)

These needs come directly from the gaps identified during the Morero Value Fit assessment, validated against the directors' aspirations. They describe the **fundamental structures and behaviours** the business must put in place before it can confidently achieve its Tier 2 contractor status and scale in a controlled way.

### 1. Transparency
**"One truth. structured data. clear communication."**

The business requires **formal, unified systems for data and reporting** to eliminate contradictory information and establish a "single source of truth." This foundational data integrity is essential for scalable decision-making and aligns with their aspiration for exit readiness.

* **Need:** Establish a Single Source of Truth for all operational and financial data.
* **Need:** Formalize and structure internal and external progress reporting to ensure clarity and consistency.
* **Need:** Align the company structure to ensure communication flows support the stated business direction.

### 2. Simplicity
**"Clear goals. simple frameworks. defined success."**

To reduce chaos and reliance on traditional methods, the business needs to transition from *ad hoc* procedures to **simple, documented, and repeatable systems.** This institutionalization of process is necessary to support team expansion and ensure consistency across a growing project portfolio.

* **Need:** Document and formalize existing operational processes and systems.
* **Need:** Standardize workflows, templates, and forms to eliminate duplicated effort and drive efficiency.
* **Need:** Clarify non-project related roles, responsibilities, and team structure to reduce confusion and reliance on key individuals.

### 3. Resilience
**"Honest risk. strong controls. stable governance."**

While operationally disciplined, the business requires **strengthened controls and formal risk awareness** to manage the complexity of larger contracts and potential financial volatility. They must systematically anticipate, acknowledge, and manage the inherent disruption of digital transformation and growth.

* **Need:** Formalize risk management structures to capture, track, and mitigate operational and transformation risks.
* **Need:** Strengthen financial controls and governance processes to ensure stability during growth and compliance with Tier 2 expectations.
* **Need:** Organize and govern the digital presence beyond marketing (internal systems, data security) to align with standards required for controlled scaling.

### 4. Growth
**"Knowledge retained. lessons learned. continuous improvement."**

To convert ambition into sustainable scaling, the business must implement **structures for cultural development and knowledge transfer.** The focus is on building capability across all teams and creating the capacity for leadership to shift from day-to-day execution to strategic oversight.

* **Need:** Create a structured leadership and capability development pathway to build capacity across the team.
* **Need:** Implement systems for knowledge retention and feedback loops to ensure lessons learned are formalized and applied company-wide.
* **Need:** Develop and communicate a clear framework for long-term career progression and retention to support team expansion.

---
**Next Step:**

With the Identified Needs defined as the **WHAT** is missing, the following **Plan** section (the "Morero Deliverables" you drafted) can now clearly be presented as the **HOW** Morero will address each of these needs over the 2-3 year timeframe.

---

This is excellent context. Having the actual Value Fit scores and comments makes the subsequent **Identified Needs** section much more credible and impactful, as it directly addresses the 'gaps' (the 'No' answers).

Your total score of **80/100** puts them in the **Strong Alignment** category, but the **20-point gap** points to specific, critical areas that must be addressed by the transformation plan.

Let's refine the **Identified Needs** section one last time to ensure every point is directly anchored to the 'No' answers in your Value Fit assessment (Q1.4, Q2.5, Q3.1, Q3.3).

---

## Identified Needs (The 'WHAT' Needs to Change)

These needs are **derived directly from the Value Fit assessment's gaps (the 'No' answers)** and must be bridged to enable the client to achieve their aspirations for Tier 2 status and controlled scaling. They define the required structural and behavioral change.

### 1. Transparency (Score: 20/25 - Gap: Q1.4)
**"One truth. structured data. clear communication."**

The business requires formal structural support to sustain its clear direction and communication. The current **family business dynamics** and **overstretched workload** (Q1.4) pose a risk to controlled scaling. This requires structural alignment to create capacity and support growth.

* **Need:** Establish a formal company structure and clear roles to alleviate overstretched workload and reduce reliance on key individuals.
* **Need:** Review governance to ensure the decision-making framework supports the clear direction and external communication.

### 2. Simplicity (Score: 20/25 - Gap: Q2.5)
**"Clear goals. simple frameworks. defined success."**

Despite having clear goals and decision-making authority, the current **reliance on traditional methods and lack of fully documented, repeatable processes** (Q2.5) creates inefficiency. The business must institutionalize its ways of working to ensure consistent, repeatable delivery as it expands.

* **Need:** Implement simple, documented, and repeatable processes, systems, and templates for all core business functions.
* **Need:** Formalize and digitize existing traditional methods to create reliable, simple frameworks for all staff to follow.

### 3. Resilience (Score: 15/25 - Gaps: Q3.1, Q3.3)
**"Honest risk. strong controls. stable governance."**

This is the most critical gap. The business faces a dual stability challenge:
1.  **Financial Stability:** **Financial challenges are evident in public filings** (Q3.1), requiring systemised controls and formalized governance to ensure stability and investor/client confidence.
2.  **Digital Controls:** The **digital footprint is disorganized, with internal systems being traditional** (Q3.3). This lack of modern, well-governed internal systems prevents operating at a Tier 2 level.

* **Need:** Establish stronger financial controls and reporting structures to formally address the stability challenges evident in public filings.
* **Need:** Modernize and organize internal digital systems (beyond marketing) to create a well-governed operational platform.
* **Need:** Formalize risk management structures to track and mitigate financial and operational risks, providing the necessary controls for growth.

### 4. Growth (Score: 25/25 - Gap: None)
**"Knowledge retained. lessons learned. continuous improvement."**

The business demonstrates **strong alignment** across all growth indicators (25/25). The focus is not on addressing a gap, but on **building sustainable infrastructure** to support and accelerate their expressed ambition.

* **Need:** Create sustainable structures for leadership development and knowledge retention to formalize their desire to work strategically.
* **Need:** Develop and communicate a clear framework for long-term career progression and retention to support the planned team expansion.
* **Need:** Build formalized structures to leverage their high ambition and proven capacity for change into continuous, systemized improvement.

---

This version ensures the narrative logic is solid: The **Needs** section is a direct, value-aligned translation of the **Value Fit** deficits, setting up the logical requirement for your subsequent **Plan**.

----

These needs are derived directly from the gaps identified in the Morero Value Fit assessment (the 20-point deficit) and represent the critical structures and behaviors that must be put in place to achieve the client's strategic Aspirations for Tier 2 status and controlled scaling.

1. Transparency (Score: 20/25 - Gap: Q1.4)
Need to Enable Exit Readiness and Profitability

The current organisational culture and structure are not aligned for growth (Q1.4) due to family business dynamics and an overstretched workload. This structural weakness prevents the achievement of Exit Readiness and sustained Profitability.

Need: Establish a Tier 1-level governance and reporting structure to formalize decision-making, alleviate workload reliance on key individuals, and demonstrate the robust management systems required for Exit Readiness.

Need: Align the company's internal structure with its stated strategic direction to ensure consistent data and capacity for scalable growth.

2. Simplicity (Score: 20/25 - Gap: Q2.5)
Need to Enable Digitalisation and Director Focus

The reliance on traditional methods and the lack of documented, repeatable processes (Q2.5) create operational friction and confusion. This inefficiency prevents successful Digitalisation and ties leadership to day-to-day tasks, inhibiting Director Focus on strategic growth.

Need: Implement simple, documented, and digitized workflows and systems to replace traditional methods and eliminate redundant effort.

Need: Create clear process maps and standardized templates to ensure consistency across the growing team, making it easy for new members to operate within simple frameworks.

3. Resilience (Score: 15/25 - Gaps: Q3.1, Q3.3)
Need to Enable Tier Progression and Warehouse Expansion

The business's most significant challenge lies in controls and stability, which are prerequisites for scaling. This is shown by financial challenges in public filings (Q3.1) and a disorganized, traditional digital footprint (Q3.3).

Need (Financial Stability): Establish systemized financial controls and formal reporting structures to address the instability concerns (Q3.1), securing the financial stability required for Tier Progression and major capital projects like Warehouse Expansion.

Need (Digital Controls): Implement modern, well-governed internal digital systems to upgrade from traditional methods (Q3.3), providing the 'Tier 1-level internal capabilities' necessary for managing major specialist packages (Tier 2 operations).

Need (Risk): Formalize risk management structures to anticipate and manage the disruption inherent in the growth required for Tier Progression.

4. Growth (Score: 25/25 - Gap: None)
Need to Sustain Revenue Growth and Team Growth

With a perfect alignment on Growth, the business's need is not to acquire ambition, but to build the sustainable infrastructure to support its strong cultural capability.

Need: Create a formalized capability development pathway to ensure Team Growth translates directly into retained knowledge and increased organizational maturity.

Need: Implement systems for knowledge retention and feedback loops to ensure their proven success in implementing changes (Q4.4) becomes repeatable and scalable, securing long-term Revenue Growth.
