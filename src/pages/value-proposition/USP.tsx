        <h2 className="content-title">Unique Value Proposition</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
            Morero exists to make governance a core function of construction delivery rather than an administrative afterthought. It is built on the principle that long-term project success depends on the quality, traceability, and alignment of decisions made over time, not simply on the efficiency of individual tasks or stages. <br /><br />

            <strong>Morero’s Role</strong><br />
            Where most construction platforms focus on tracking activity and outputs, Morero captures the reasoning behind decisions. It records why changes occur, how risks are assessed, and how outcomes align with defined project goals, creating a continuous and defensible project history. <br /><br />

            <strong>Governance at the Core</strong><br />
            Morero embeds accountability, oversight, and decision context directly into the project lifecycle. Governance operates in real time, supporting clearer trade-offs, earlier risk visibility, and more resilient decision-making in complex and regulated construction environments. This governance-first approach is supported by deterministic automation that structures information and enforces consistency, ensuring decisions remain auditable, and trustworthy.<br /><br />

            <strong>Alignment to Long-Term Value</strong><br />
            By linking decisions, risks, and changes to explicit project objectives, Morero keeps delivery aligned to intended outcomes rather than short-term milestones. This supports value-based delivery, sustainability objectives, and responsible investment management across portfolios. <br /><br />

            <strong>Every Change. Captured.</strong><br />
            Morero turns change from a source of uncertainty into a structured asset. Each change is recorded with rationale, impact, and alignment, enabling accountability, learning, and continuous improvement across projects and organisations. <br /><br />
